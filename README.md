## ✨ Features

- **📅 Lecture Timetables**: View weekly schedules for any degree programme and year of study. Highlight followed courses (*"I Miei Corsi"*) and spot cancelled lectures automatically.
- **🏛️ Classroom Occupancy**: Accurate real-time room status across all campus buildings (U1–U28) synchronized with client time. See whether an aula is currently free or occupied, inspect whole-day schedules, and search quickly with interactive classroom suggestions.
- **📍 Campus Maps & Geolocation**: Direct Google Maps geolocation pins for all Bicocca buildings (U1–U28), accessible from classroom badges in cards, the building selector, and the classroom schedule modal.
- **🧑‍🏫 Professor Schedules**: Directory search across UNIMIB faculty with weekly lecture schedules, semester events, and institutional contact info.
- **📝 Exam Calendar**: Track upcoming exam appeals for your degree with session filters (Winter, Summer, Autumn, or Custom with validated date pickers). Features dynamic study-year filters matching your course duration and autocomplete search for exam titles and faculty.
- **👥 Study Groups & Shared Calendars**: Create or join multiple study groups via code or link. View combined schedules, overlapping courses, and automatic common free slots to coordinate study sessions or lunch breaks.
- **📥 Calendar Export & WebCal**: Export schedules to iCalendar (`.ics`), CSV (Excel), or JSON. Subscribe via a live WebCal feed (`webcal://`) to automatically sync with Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, or Outlook.
- **👤 Cloud Profile & Multi-Device Sync**: Optional lightweight account (nickname + PIN) backed by Redis to keep your courses, exams, and group memberships in sync across devices.
- **📱 Mobile-First PWA**: Dark mode, Alpine.js reactive UI, Lucide icons, swipe gestures, and offline support via Service Worker.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3 (Mobile-First responsive dark theme), PWA Service Worker.
- **Backend**: Python serverless functions on Vercel (`api/*.py`, Python standard library only).
- **Storage**: Upstash Redis (REST API) for user profiles and shared groups.
- **Scraper Source**: Live queries to official UNIMIB EasyCourse endpoints (`grid_call.php`, `combo.php`, `bookings_call.php`).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Development

Run the frontend and serverless API locally using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli):

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if needed
npm i -g vercel

# Start local development server
vercel dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Nota per Windows:** assicurarsi che l'interprete Python sia installato e accessibile da riga di comando come `python` o `python3` nel PATH di sistema, affinché Vercel CLI possa instanziare correttamente i runtime Python serverless in locale.

### Running Tests

Run the full test suite with npm:

```bash
npm test
```

Or execute backend / frontend suites individually:

```bash
# Python backend tests
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/backend -p "test_*.py"

# Frontend Node.js tests
npm run test:frontend
```

### Environment Variables

To enable cloud profiles and study group syncing, configure your Upstash Redis credentials in `.env.local` (or in Vercel Project Settings):

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | Upstash Redis REST endpoint URL |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Upstash Redis REST bearer token |
